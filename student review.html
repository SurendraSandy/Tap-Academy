            <u><b> <li>Sumanth</li></b></u>
            <dl>I'm Sumanth, an electrical student. I joined Tap Academy in July. I didn't know much about programming at first, but my knowledge gradually increased. I'm grateful to all the faculty, especially Rohit Sir and Megha Ma'am, for their excellent teaching. I'm now happy with my programming background.</dl>

            <dl>I think a Tap Academy is doing great using latest technologies ... Something i really appreciate about Tap Academy is the way of teaching using Animations.... With your guidance i have developed confidence & skill set in Java.. One of the things i admire about TAP Academy is giving Quality Education at affordable Price.. - Sasank</dl>
